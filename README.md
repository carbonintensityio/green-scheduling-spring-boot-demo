# Green Scheduling Spring Boot Demo

This is a demo project showcasing the integration of the [Green Scheduling Scheduler](https://github.com/carbonintensityio/scheduler) with a Spring Boot application. The goal of this demo is to provide an example of how to utilize carbon intensity data for scheduling tasks, helping to make more energy-efficient decisions for your application.

## Overview

The `green-scheduling-spring-boot-demo` project demonstrates how to schedule tasks based on real-time carbon intensity data, optimizing energy consumption by aligning tasks with periods of lower carbon emissions. This can help organizations make greener, more sustainable decisions in their application workflows.
